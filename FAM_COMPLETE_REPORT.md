**Solution**: Switched to Ubuntu 22.04-based image with full Playwright support

**Changes Made:**
```dockerfile
# Before: python:3.11-slim (Debian)
FROM python:3.11-slim

# After: ubuntu:22.04 (Ubuntu)
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Added: Playwright browser installation
RUN playwright install chromium && \
    playwright install-deps chromium
```

**Rebuild Time**: ~8-10 minutes
**Image Size**: Increased to ~700MB (includes Chromium browser)

## Data Verification

### API Endpoint Tests

#### 1. Multi-Version Sections Verified

```bash
# FAM §3044
$ curl https://www.codecond.com/api/v2/codes/FAM/sections/3044
{
  "is_multi_version": true,
  "has_full_content": true,
  "versions": [
    {
      "version_number": 1,
      "description": "(Amended by Stats. 2024, Ch. 544, Sec. 6.)",
      "content": "[Full text...]",
      "is_current": true
    },
    {
      "version_number": 2,
      "description": "(Repealed and added by Stats. 2024, Ch. 544, Sec. 7.)",
      "content": "[Full text...]",
      "is_current": false,
      "operative_date": "2026-01-01"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. All 7 Multi-Version Sections Have Data

✅ FAM §3044 - `is_multi_version: true, has_full_content: true`
✅ FAM §6389 - `is_multi_version: true, has_full_content: true`
✅ FAM §17400 - `is_multi_version: true, has_full_content: true`
✅ FAM §17404.1 - `is_multi_version: true, has_full_content: true`
✅ FAM §17430 - `is_multi_version: true, has_full_content: true`
✅ FAM §17432 - `is_multi_version: true, has_full_content: true`
✅ FAM §17504 - `is_multi_version: true, has_full_content: true`

## Known Issue: API Statistics Count

### Current Behavior

The `/api/v2/codes` statistics endpoint shows:
```json
{
  "code": "FAM",
  "total_urls": 1626,
  "sections_with_content": 1619,
  "coverage_percentage": 99.57%
}
```

### Actual Data

All 1,626 sections are present in MongoDB with full content:
- 1,619 single-version sections
- 7 multi-version sections (each with multiple versions)

### Root Cause

The API statistics query likely counts based on:
- `has_content: true` field on section documents
- Multi-version sections may have different field structure
- API aggregation may not properly count multi-version sections

### Impact

- ✅ **No user impact** - All sections accessible
- ✅ **Data is 100% complete** - Verified by direct queries
- ⚠️ **Statistics display only** - Shows 99.57% instead of 100%

### Fix Required (Future)

Update `legal-codes-api` statistics endpoint to properly count multi-version sections:
- Include sections where `is_multi_version: true`
- Count based on `has_full_content: true` instead of `has_content: true`
- Or use `db.section_contents.countDocuments({code: "FAM"})` for accurate count

## Dockerfile Improvements

### Changes Made

**Before** (Debian-based, ~200MB):
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# Playwright NOT installed
```

**After** (Ubuntu-based, ~700MB):
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get install -y python3.11 python3-pip wget curl
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
RUN playwright install chromium
RUN playwright install-deps chromium
```

### Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **OS Support** | Debian (partial) | Ubuntu 22.04 (full) | Better compatibility |
| **Playwright** | Manual install | Pre-installed | Ready to use |
| **Multi-Version** | Failed | Working | 100% coverage |
| **Image Size** | ~200MB | ~700MB | Trade-off for functionality |

### Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full Playwright support out of the box
- ✅ Ubuntu official support
- ✅ No manual browser installation needed
- ✅ Multi-version sections work perfectly

**Cons:**
- ❌ Larger image size (700MB vs 200MB)
- ❌ Longer build time (~10 min vs ~3 min)
- ❌ More disk space required

**Verdict**: Worth it for production use - multi-version data is critical for legal accuracy

   - Properly count multi-version sections
   - Show 100% instead of 99.57%

### Next Steps

With Playwright now working, the pipeline can:

✅ **Process remaining 26 California codes** with full multi-version support
✅ **Extract all historical versions** for legal research
✅ **Maintain 99-100% success rates**

**Estimated time for 26 codes**: 4-6 hours total

---

## Technical Details

### Multi-Version Sections Explained

Multi-version sections are legal code sections with:
- **Current version**: Active now
- **Future version**: Becomes operative on specific date
- **Historical versions**: Previously effective versions

**Example - FAM §3044**:
- **Version 1**: Effective Jan 1, 2025 - Repeals Jan 1, 2026
- **Version 2**: Operative Jan 1, 2026 (future law change)

**Why it matters**: Legal professionals need to see upcoming changes to prepare for new laws.

### Playwright Integration

**How it works:**
1. Firecrawl detects multi-version indicator
2. Pipeline uses Playwright to:
   - Open leginfo.legislature.ca.gov page
   - Click "Select from Multiple" link
   - Extract all version descriptions
   - Scrape each version's full text
3. Store all versions in MongoDB

**Dependencies:**
- Chromium browser (~150MB)
- System libraries for browser automation
- Ubuntu OS for full compatibility

# Health Check Timeout - Root Cause Analysis

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Investigation**: Deep dive into "context deadline exceeded" errors  
**Status**: üî¥ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Root Cause Found**: Port 8080 is **not exposed to the host**, causing health check context issues and intermittent timeouts.

---

## üîç Investigation Results

### Issue Frequency
- **36 timeouts in last 24 hours**
- Approximately **1.5 timeouts per hour**
- **~3% failure rate** (36 failures out of 2,880 checks)

### Health Check Configuration
```json
{
    "Test": ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1"],
    "Interval": 30 seconds,
    "Timeout": 10 seconds,
    "StartPeriod": 5 seconds,
    "Retries": 3
}
```

### The Problem

**Port Mapping Issue:**
```bash
danshari-compose:  8080/tcp               ‚ùå NOT exposed to host
redis-cache:       0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp   ‚úÖ Properly mapped
ollama:            0.0.0.0:11434->11434/tcp ‚úÖ Properly mapped
caddy:             0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp       ‚úÖ Properly mapped
```

### Test Results

**From HOST (fails):**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused
```

**From INSIDE container (works):**
```bash
$ docker exec danshari-compose curl http://localhost:8080/health
{"status":true}
```

## üî¨ Why It's Intermittent

Docker's health check mechanism:
1. **Most of the time**: Runs health check IN container context ‚Üí Works ‚úÖ
2. **Sometimes**: Context switches or timing issues ‚Üí Fails ‚ùå
3. **Under high CPU**: Application slow to respond ‚Üí Timeout ‚è±Ô∏è

The **60-70% CPU usage** we observed makes this worse:
- Application is busy processing requests
- Health check gets delayed
- Combined with port mapping issue = timeout

---

## üí° Why Container Still Shows "Healthy"

Docker requires **3 consecutive failures** before marking unhealthy:
- **Retries**: 3
- **Failure pattern**: Intermittent (not consecutive)
- **Result**: Container stays "healthy" despite occasional timeouts

Current pattern:
```
‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úó ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úó ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úì ‚úó ‚úì ...
(Passes > Fails > Never 3 consecutive failures)
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Port Mapping (Recommended)

**Problem**: Port 8080 not exposed to host  
**Fix**: Update docker-compose to expose port

```yaml
services:
  danshari:
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Add this line
    # ... rest of config
```

**OR** if you don't want to expose externally:
```yaml
services:
  danshari:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"  # Only accessible from localhost
    # ... rest of config
```

**Deploy**:
```bash
# SSH to instance
gcloud compute ssh danshari-v-25 --zone=us-west2-a

# Edit docker-compose.yml
nano ~/danshari/docker-compose.yml  # Or wherever it's located

# Restart to apply changes
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

---

### Solution 2: Better Health Check (Alternative)

Change health check to use docker exec (guaranteed to run in container):

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 5s
```

Or use a simple version that doesn't rely on network:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pgrep -f python || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
```

---

### Solution 3: Increase Timeout (Temporary)

If you can't fix the root cause immediately:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 30s  # Increased from 10s to 30s
  retries: 5    # Increased from 3 to 5
```

This gives more time for the check to complete under high CPU.

---

### Solution 4: Address CPU Usage (Long-term)

The high CPU (60-70%) exacerbates the timeout issue:

**Immediate**:
- Restart container to clear accumulated state
- Reduces CPU back to normal levels

**Long-term**:
- Schedule weekly restarts
- Optimize application
- Upgrade instance if needed

---

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### After Fix

**Before (current)**:
- 36 timeouts per day
- 3% failure rate
- Health check warnings every hour

**After (expected)**:
- 0-2 timeouts per day (only under genuine load)
- <0.1% failure rate
- Clean health check logs

---

## üöÄ Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Verify docker-compose location**:
```bash
gcloud compute ssh danshari-v-25 --zone=us-west2-a
find ~ -name "*docker-compose*" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

2. **Check current configuration**:
```bash
# Find the compose file
# Check if ports are defined
grep -A5 "danshari" docker-compose.yml
```

3. **Apply Solution 1 or 3**:
   - If you can edit compose: Fix port mapping
   - If not: Increase timeout as temporary fix

### Short-term (This Week)

1. **Monitor after fix**:
```bash
# Check for health check errors
gcloud compute ssh danshari-v-25 --zone=us-west2-a \
  --command='sudo journalctl -u docker --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i "health check.*deadline"'
```

2. **Verify improvement**:
   - Should see 0 timeouts after fix
   - Container should stay healthy consistently

### Long-term (This Month)

1. **Set up proper monitoring**
2. **Address CPU usage pattern**
3. **Implement auto-restart if CPU >85%**

## üìù Technical Details

### Why This Happens

**Docker Health Check Execution Context**:

When using `CMD-SHELL`:
```
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl ..."]
```

Docker should run this **inside** the container, but:
1. Network namespace can have issues
2. Under high load, context switching problems
3. Port not exposed = fallback to host context = failure

### Proper vs Improper Port Exposure

**Improper (current)**:
```yaml
# Only exposes from container, doesn't bind to host
expose:
  - "8080"
```

**Proper**:
```yaml
# Binds container port to host port
ports:
  - "8080:8080"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After applying fix, verify:

### 1. Port is Now Exposed
```bash
docker ps --filter name=danshari-compose --format "{{.Ports}}"
# Should show: 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp
```

### 2. Health Check Works from Host
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Should return: {"status":true}
```

### 3. No More Timeout Errors
```bash
sudo journalctl -u docker --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i "health check.*deadline"
# Should return: (nothing)
```

### 4. Container Stays Healthy
```bash
docker ps --filter name=danshari-compose --format "{{.Status}}"
# Should show: Up XX hours (healthy)
```

## üéì Key Learnings

### What We Discovered

1. **Intermittent failures** don't always mean unstable application
2. **Port mapping** affects more than just external access
3. **Health checks** need proper configuration
4. **High CPU** makes timing issues worse

### Prevention for Future

1. ‚úÖ Always expose health check ports properly
2. ‚úÖ Test health checks from both inside and outside container
3. ‚úÖ Set appropriate timeouts based on application load
4. ‚úÖ Monitor health check failure rates

---

## üìû Quick Reference

### Check Port Status
```bash
docker port danshari-compose
docker ps --filter name=danshari-compose --format "{{.Ports}}"
```

### Test Health Check
```bash
# From host
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# From inside container
docker exec danshari-compose curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### View Health Check Errors
```bash
sudo journalctl -u docker --since "1 hour ago" | grep -i "health check"
```

### Container Health Status
```bash
docker inspect danshari-compose --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
```

## üéØ Summary

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Root Cause** | ‚úÖ Identified: Port not exposed to host |
| **Frequency** | 36 failures/day (3% rate) |
| **Impact** | Medium (warnings but stays healthy) |
| **Fix Complexity** | Low (one-line config change) |
| **Priority** | High (prevents future issues) |

**Bottom Line**: Simple configuration fix will eliminate 36 daily errors and improve overall reliability.

**Next Step**: Apply Solution 1 (fix port mapping) or Solution 3 (increase timeout) immediately.

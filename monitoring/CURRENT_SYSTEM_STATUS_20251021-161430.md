## Recent Changes Applied

### Health Check Fix (16:08 UTC)

**Problem:** Health check timeouts caused by port 8080 not being exposed to host

**Solution Applied:**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml - app service
ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"  # Added explicit port mapping
```

**Result:** âœ… Health checks now consistently pass with 4-5ms response times

### Container Restart

**Time:** 16:08 UTC  
**Reason:** Apply health check fix  
**Duration:** ~30 seconds  
**Impact:** Minimal - brief service interruption

## Performance Metrics

### Processing Speed

| Phase | Time | Rate | Batches/Sections |
|-------|------|------|------------------|
| **Stage 1** | 5.86 min (352s) | ~16 sections/sec | 609 pages |
| **Stage 2** | 39.75 min (2,385s) | ~2.4 sections/sec | 114 batches × 50 |
| **Stage 3** | 6.59 min (395s) | Multi-version | Playwright extraction |

**Overall Throughput**: ~1.8 sections/second (5,660 sections ÷ 52 min)

**Note**: Stage 2 was slower than validated test (39.75 min vs 24 min expected). Likely due to:
- Network variability
- Firecrawl API rate limiting
- Time of day/server load
- Still 3x faster than old pipeline

### Performance vs Expectations

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Variance |
|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Stage 1** | ~8 min | 5.86 min | ✅ Faster |
| **Stage 2** | ~24 min | 39.75 min | ⚠️ +66% slower |
| **Stage 3** | ~6 min | 6.59 min | ✅ On target |
| **Total** | ~38 min | ~52 min | ⚠️ +37% slower |

**Still Acceptable**: Even with slower performance, still **~3-4x faster** than old pipeline (~180 min)

## Failed Sections Analysis

### 2 Sections Failed (Empty Content)

| Section | Error Type | Stage | Reason |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------|
| **PEN §590** | empty_content | Stage 2 | No content extracted (may be repealed) |
| **PEN §591** | empty_content | Stage 2 | No content extracted (may be repealed) |

### Root Cause

**Empty content failures** typically indicate:
1. **Repealed sections** - No longer in effect
2. **Reserved sections** - Placeholders for future use
3. **Redirected sections** - Moved to different location

**Impact**: Minimal - these sections likely have no content on leginfo.legislature.ca.gov either

**Retry Attempted**: Auto-retry cannot fix empty content (source has no data)

**Recommendation**: Mark as abandoned or investigate manually on leginfo site

## Known Issues

### 1. API Statistics Counting

**Issue**: API statistics show lower counts than actual

| Code | API Shows | Actual | Difference |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| EVID | 506 (100%) | 506 (100%) | ✅ Accurate |
| FAM | 1,619 (99.57%) | 1,626 (100%) | -7 multi-version |
| CCP | 3,347 (99.79%) | 3,353 (100%) | -6 multi-version |
| PEN | 5,619 (99.28%) | 5,658 (99.96%) | -39 multi-version +2 failed |

**Root Cause**: API counting doesn't properly handle multi-version sections

**Impact**: Display only - all data is accessible

### 2. PEN Performance Slower Than Expected

**Expected**: ~38 minutes
**Actual**: ~52 minutes (+37%)

**Possible Causes**:
- Firecrawl API rate limiting
- Network latency during late-night hours
- Larger code size (5,660 sections)
- Server load on leginfo.legislature.ca.gov

**Impact**: Still 3.5x faster than old pipeline, acceptable

### 3. Two Empty Content Sections

**PEN §590 and §591**: No content available

**Reason**: Likely repealed or reserved sections

**Cannot Fix**: No data available at source

---

## Performance Comparison

### PEN: Old vs New Pipeline

| Metric | Old Pipeline | New Pipeline (v0.2) | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Total Time** | ~180 minutes | **52 minutes** | **3.5x faster** |
| **Architecture** | ~30 min | 5.86 min | 5x faster |
| **Content** | ~140 min | 39.75 min | 3.5x faster |
| **Multi-version** | ~10 min | 6.59 min | 1.5x faster |
| **Success Rate** | ~95% | **99.96%** | Better |
| **Failures** | ~250 sections | **2 sections** | 125x better |

**Time Savings**: **128 minutes saved** (~2.1 hours per run)

## Recommendations

### For PEN §590 and §591

**Option 1: Investigate Manually**
```bash
# Check on leginfo.legislature.ca.gov manually
# Verify if sections are actually repealed
```

**Option 2: Mark as Abandoned**
```bash
docker exec ca-fire-pipeline python scripts/retry_failed_sections.py PEN --section 590 --abandon "Repealed section - no content available"
docker exec ca-fire-pipeline python scripts/retry_failed_sections.py PEN --section 591 --abandon "Repealed section - no content available"
```

**Option 3: Accept 99.96%**
- 5,658/5,660 is excellent coverage
- 2 missing sections won't impact users
- Can investigate later if needed

**Recommendation**: **Accept 99.96%** - this is production-quality

## Next Steps

### Remaining 26 California Codes

With 4 codes successfully validated, the pipeline is ready for the remaining 26:

**Codes to Process:**
BPC, COM, CORP, EDC, ELEC, FGC, FIN, GOV, HNC, HSC, INS, LAB, MVC, PCC, PROB, PRC, PUC, RTC, SHC, UIC, VEH, WAT, WIC, etc.

**Estimated Total Time**: 4-6 hours

**Processing Strategy:**
1. Small codes first (<1,000 sections)
2. Medium codes (1,000-3,000 sections)
3. Large codes last (>3,000 sections)

**Expected Success Rate**: 99-100% based on validation
